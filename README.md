This repo contains the code that 
- Builds and trains a simple neural network 
- Transform the model weights to integer (fix precision)
- wrap the model around MLModel class (core/models) and save the model

Using the saved model, one can use modify code to [edufoursans/reading-in-the-dark](https://github.com/edufoursans/reading-in-the-dark) functional encrypt the quad-model (two layers proj1 and diag1 of model above) to test on MNIST data
